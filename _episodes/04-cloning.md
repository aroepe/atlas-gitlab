## Delete your local repository (!)

First, **make sure your repository on GitLab is there!**

Now let's do something super careless: go to the directory above your repository and run

~~~
rm -rf amber-example
~~~
{: .source}

Poof: gone just like that! This is a contrived case but this _will_ happen to you at some point in the future.

[^1]: If you're curious about other things that you should only ever
    use with extreme caution:

       - `sudo` elevates your privileges to allow you to delete files you
          normally can't
       - `rm -rf *` will remove everything in your current directory,
          recursively, without asking for confirmation to remove
          writable files.

    The ultimate nuclear option is thus `sudo rm -rf *`. Please don't
    ever use this.

## Bring your local repository back

Good thing we just pushed to GitLab. Let's clone the repository
again. Go to your ''`amber-example`'' repository on GitLab again, click
"Clone" button again and copy the "Clone with SSH" url. Then run

~~~
git clone <copied url>
~~~
{: .bash}

You should be back where you were before you deleted everything.

> ## Cloning with other protocols
>
> Here we assumed that you used the `ssh` method, but GitLab allows
> you to clone with `kerberos` or via `https` as well. All will work
> equally well, your choice should be based on what you consider most
> convenient.
