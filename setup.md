We assume that you already have a CERN account.  To ensure that your
gitlab account is active, go to [gitlab.cern.ch](gitlab.cern.ch).

You should find your very own gitlab homepage!

If you're having issues, **please notify your instructor immediately**
since you won't be able to follow this lesson without access to CERN's
Gitlab.
